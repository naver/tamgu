# TAMGU (탐구): A FIL Language

TAMGU is a __FIL__ programming language: __Functional, Imperative and Logical__. 

TAMGU is a _multithreaded programming language_ that provides: 

* an _imperative_ formalism close to Python, but with a strong and powerful type system. 
* a _functional_ formalism inspired by Haskell, which can freely mix with the _imperative_ paradigm
* a _logical_ formalism inspired by Prolog, which can freely mix with the _imperative_ and _functional_ paradigms

_For each specific problem in your programming, choose the most appropriate formalism and freely mix functional, imperative and logical approaches to implement the most expressive but also the most compact code possible._

### Annotation
TAMGU provides also an annotation language implementation (see below for an example), which allows for an efficient way to detect complex patterns in text. 

The language provides many features but also many libraries, which helps design and implement annotation schemes for complex documents.

## Code Example

Below is an example of the kind of code that you can implement with _Tamgu_.

```C++

//An imperative language

int i=10;
string s="20";
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Containers

map m = {'a':1, 'b':2}; //all sorts of containers
treemap t = {"u":10, 'v':'toto'};
vector v = [1,2,3,"a","b"];
ivector iv = [1..10]; //iv = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
iv = [1,3..10]; //iv = [1,3,5,9]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Functions, threads and frames

function mycall(int i, string s) {...} //functions
thread mythread(int i, string s) {...} //threads
frame myclass {...} //class definition
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Native Korean string support

s="에버랜드 알쏭달쏭 Quiz";
if (s[0].ishangul()) println("Ok");
uvector dec = s.jamo(); //['ᄋ','ᅦ','ᄇ','ᅥ','ᄅ','ᅢ','ᆫ','ᄃ','ᅳ'...]
dec = s.romanization(); //['-/ng','e','b','eo','r/l','ae','n','d',...]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Functional approach based on Haskell

ivector iv = [1..20]; //a list of integers between 1 and 20
iv.shuffle(); //The order of the elements is now random.

<fastsort([]) = []>;  //if the list is empty, we return an empty "list"
<fastsort([fv:v]) =  minlist &&& fv &&& maxlist where //we merge the different list...
    let minlist = fastsort(<filter (<=fv) v>), //we sort the list with elements smaller than fv
    let maxlist = fastsort(<filter (>fv) v>)>; //we sort the list with elements larger than fv

//we can call a functional definition as regular code
v=fastsort(iv); 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Predicates

concat([],?X,?X).
concat([?H|?T],?Y, [?H|?Z]) :- concat(?T,?Y,?Z).

//You can mix freely your predicate definition with some regular tamgu code
v=concat(["english",'russian',"french"],['spanish'],?L);
println(v); //["english",'russian',"french","spanish"]

```

## Annotation Example 

Tamgu also provides an integrated rule mechanism, which combines both lexicons and rules to detect complex patterns in texts.


```Java

//We define some lexical rules (starting with a "@")
@food <- burger.
@food <- tartare.


//Our rule: if "the food" word is found in a sentence, then we return a "meal" label 
meal <- "the", #food.

//We need a specific object to scan a sentence
annotator r;

//a sentence
string sentence="Here, the burger and the tartare are delicious.";
vector v = r.parse(sentence); 

//Result: v =  [['meal',[10,16]],['meal',[25,32]]]
//It reads: two 'meal' were found at position 10-16 and position 25-32...

```

## Pre-compiled Releases
__Note__: _Releases_ for Windows, Mac OS and Linux are available at: https://github.com/naver/tamgu/releases

## Documentation
The documentation is in : 

**[English Documentation](https://github.com/naver/tamgu/blob/master/documentations/English/README.md)**

**[한국어 문서](https://github.com/naver/tamgu/blob/master/documentations/Korean/README.md)**

## Examples

Examples are available both as a folder: https://github.com/naver/tamgu/tree/master/examples or as an archive in: https://github.com/naver/tamgu/releases/tag/tamgu.examples.

## Compiling

The TAMGU project has been implemented in C++. It can be compiled on most platforms:

* Windows: see https://github.com/naver/tamgu/wiki/1.1-Compiling-on-Windows
* Mac OS: see https://github.com/naver/tamgu/wiki/1.2-Compiling-on-Mac-OS
* Linux: see https://github.com/naver/tamgu/wiki/1.3-Compiling-on-Linux

### Libraries
Tamgu also provides different libraries:

Compiling libraries: https://github.com/naver/tamgu/wiki/1.4-Compiling-libraries-(Linux-&-Mac-OS)

#### Windows requirements for: libsound and libwapti

These two libraries need the following DLL on Windows, which you can obtained from: _http://www.mingw.org_

```
libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll
libltdl-7.dll
libstdc++-6.dll
libwinpthread-1.dll
```

### Python
Furthermore, Tamgu provides a bi-directional library, which can be used to execute Tamgu code from Python (and conversely, Python code in Tamgu)

See: https://github.com/naver/tamgu/wiki/1.5-Compiling-Python for more information
