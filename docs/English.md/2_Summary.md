## Summary

This document provides an overview of the Tamgu language.

Tamgu is an imperative language with a predicate engine inspired by Prolog and functional capabilities inspired by the Haskell language. These three programming styles can be freely mixed together.

Tamgu also allows the language to be extended with external libraries. Some of these libraries are described in this document. For example, Tamgu provides graphical capabilities, sound capabilities, and database management through an encapsulation of SQLite.

The language is available on multiple platforms, including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, and various flavors of UNIX.
