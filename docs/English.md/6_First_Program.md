# First Program

To provide a clear example, here is a small program that displays the content of a string.

```python
# Declaration
s = ""
i = 0

# Instantiation
s = "abcd"
i = 100

# Display
print("S =", s, "I =", i)
```

Execution:

```
S = abcd I = 100
```

This program demonstrates the basic concepts of variable declaration, instantiation, and display in Python.
