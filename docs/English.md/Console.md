## Console

Tamgu provides a default console that can be used to load and edit any programs. The console is useful for testing small pieces of code or checking values at the end of execution.

Additionally, you can execute a program in debug mode, which displays the content of the stack and variables at each step of your program.

To launch the console, run Tamgu with the command: `-console`.
