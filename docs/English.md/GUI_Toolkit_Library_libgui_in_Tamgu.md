# GUI Toolkit Library (libgui) in Tamgu

The GUI Toolkit Library (libgui) in Tamgu is a graphical C++ library that has been implemented for various platforms, including Windows and Mac OS. It is based on the FLTK library (http://www.fltk.org/). 

We have integrated FLTK into the Tamgu library to enhance the language with GUI capabilities. While not all features of FLTK have been fully implemented in the Tamgu library, the available methods are sufficient to build simple yet powerful interfaces.

To use this library, simply include the following line at the beginning of your file: `use("gui");`

Please note the following:
- Tamgu has been linked with FLTK 1.3.
- The associate function methodology has been extended to most graphical objects.
