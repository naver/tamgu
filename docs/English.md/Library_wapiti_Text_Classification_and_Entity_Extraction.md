Wapiti provides an efficient implementation of the CRF method for tagging and entity extraction. If you need any information about the system, please refer to the manual at [http://wapiti.limsi.fr/manual.html](http://wapiti.limsi.fr/manual.html).

## Usage

The name of the library is **wapiti**. To use it, use the following command: `use('wapiti');`

**libwapiti** exposes the following methods:

### Methods

1. `loadmodel(string crfmodel)`: Load a CRF model.
2. `options(svector options)`: Set options. See below for the available options. Options should be placed in the svector as used on the command line of wapiti.
3. `train()`: Launch training. Requires options to be set in advance.
4. `label(vector words)`: Launch labeling for a vector of tokens. Returns a vector of labels for each token.
5. `lasterror()`: Return the last error that occurred.

### Options

Wapiti exposes some options to deal with all the possibilities embedded in the system. Below is a list of these options, which should be supplied as a svector, exactly as these options would be provided with the command line version of wapiti.

- Train mode:
  - `train [options] [input data] [model file]`
  - `-s` or `--score`: Add scores to output.
  - `-p` or `--post`: Label using posteriors.
  - `-n` or `--nbest INT`: Output n-best list.
  - `--force`: Use forced decoding.

## Training

To train a CRF, you need a text file with annotations, where each line is a token with its tags separated by a tab.

Example:
```
UNITED STATES  NOUN  LOCATION_b
SECURITIES  NOUN  ORGANISATION_i
AND  CONJ  ORGANISATION_i
EXCHANGE  NOUN  ORGANISATION_i
COMMISSION  NOUN  ORGANISATION_i
Washington  NOUN  ORGANISATION_i
, PUNCT  ORGANISATION_i
D.C. NOUN  LOCATION_b
20549  DIG NUMBER_b
FORM  VERB  null
N NOUN  null
```

In this example, each line represents a token associated with two different tags. The tag "null" in this example is a simple string that does not have a specific interpretation except for this specific example.

You also need a "pattern" file, which should be implemented according to the manual of CRF++ (on which it is based) or as described in [http://wapiti.limsi.fr/manual.html](http://wapiti.limsi.fr/manual.html).

Example pattern file:
```
# Unigram
U00:%x[-2,0]
U01:%x[-1,0]
U02:%x[0,0]
U03:%x[1,0]
U04:%x[2,0]
U05:%x[-2,1]
U06:%x[-1,1]
U07:%x[0,1]
U08:%x[1,1]
U09:%x[2,1]
U10:%x[-2,0]/%x[0,0]
U11:%x[-1,0]/%x[0,0]
U12:%x[0,0]/%x[1,0]
U13:%x[0,0]/%x[2,0]
U14:%x[-2,1]/%x[0,1]
U15:%x[-1,1]/%x[0,1]
U16:%x[0,1]/%x[1,1]
U17:%x[0,1]/%x[2,1]
# Bigram
B
```

## Program

Here is an example program that takes a training file and a pattern file as input to produce the model that will be used to label entities.

```python
use('wapiti');
wapiti tst;

# We are going to produce our model based on the pattern file and the training file
svector v = ["train", "-p", "pattern", "-1", "5", "training", "model"];
tst.options(v);
tst.train();
```

## Labeling

The labeling is done through the method `label`. In order to use this method, you must first load the model that you produced through training. The process consists of sending a list of tokens and receiving as output a vector of the same size containing the corresponding labels. You need to provide the system with a list of tokens, each associated with their specific tags.
