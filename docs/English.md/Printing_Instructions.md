## Printing Instructions

The following instructions are used to display results on the current display port:

- `print`: This instruction prints the result on the current display port.
- `println`: This instruction prints the result on the current display port and adds a carriage return at the end of the line.
- `printerr`: This instruction prints the result on the standard error output.
- `printlnerr`: This instruction prints the result on the standard error output and adds a carriage return at the end of the line.

The "ln" versions of the instructions have two additional features:
1. For values separated with a comma, an additional space is added.
2. A carriage return is added at the end of the line.

These instructions are commonly used for displaying output in programming languages.
