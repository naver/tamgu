# Tamgu Regular Expression (treg)

Tamgu provides a formalism for regular expressions called treg. 

treg is both a type and a specific way to write regular expressions. It takes a string as an argument, which follows the description below. Alternatively, it can be provided directly as a string in the form of r"...", where the 'r' stands for regular expressions.
