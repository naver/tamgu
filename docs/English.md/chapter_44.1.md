# Dependency and Synode in Tamgu

Dependencies are a crucial linguistic concept that has become an essential part of modern Natural Language Processing. Tamgu offers a specific implementation of dependencies based on the predicate engine. The objective of this implementation is to take the output of a dependency parser analysis (such as the Stanford parser) as input and perform additional analysis based on this output.

Dependencies are evaluated as predicates that connect syntactic nodes. In our system, we provide a second type called "synode" which represents a node from a constituent tree.

## Usage

To use the dependency and synode features in Tamgu, follow these steps:

1. Install Tamgu on your system.
2. Obtain the output of a dependency parser analysis, such as the Stanford parser.
3. Use the Tamgu predicate engine to analyze the dependency output and perform further analysis.
4. Utilize the synode type to represent nodes from a constituent tree.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use Tamgu to analyze dependencies and synodes:

```python
import tamgu

# Load the dependency output from the Stanford parser
dependency_output = load_dependency_output("dependency_output.txt")

# Create a Tamgu predicate engine
engine = tamgu.PredicateEngine()

# Analyze the dependency output
dependencies = engine.analyze_dependencies(dependency_output)

# Perform further analysis on the dependencies
for dependency in dependencies:
    # Access the syntactic nodes connected by the dependency
    source_node = dependency.source_node
    target_node = dependency.target_node
    
    # Print the source and target nodes
    print("Source node:", source_node)
    print("Target node:", target_node)
    
    # Perform additional analysis on the nodes
    
    # Create a synode from the source node
    synode = tamgu.Synode(source_node)
    
    # Perform operations on the synode
    
    # Print the synode
    print("Synode:", synode)
```

In the above example, we first load the output of a dependency parser analysis. Then, we create a Tamgu predicate engine and use it to analyze the dependency output. We can access the syntactic nodes connected by each dependency and perform further analysis on them. Additionally, we create a synode from the source node and perform operations on it.

## Conclusion

Tamgu provides a powerful implementation of dependencies and synodes, allowing for advanced linguistic analysis. By utilizing the Tamgu predicate engine, users can analyze dependency output from parsers like the Stanford parser and perform additional operations on the syntactic nodes.
